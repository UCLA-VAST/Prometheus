Optimal solution found (tolerance 1.00e-04)
Warning: max constraint violation (2.9504e-03) exceeds tolerance
Warning: max general constraint violation (2.9504e-03) exceeds tolerance
  Piecewise linearization of function constraints often causes big violation.
  Try to adjust the settings of the related parameters, such as FuncPieces.
